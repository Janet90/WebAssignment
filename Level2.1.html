            <li>TI believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve, you should face it with rationality, logic and careful analysis if you want to get to the right idea.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphic design is always a synthetic work: you need to reduce and remove until you reach the core of the message. </li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you work with typography and lettering, the essential goal is to obtain the best possible legibility.</li>
        
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this result, it is fundamental to know typography and its history. </li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer has become an essential tool but its undisputed utility and versatility cannot replace knowledge.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As extraordinary as this instrument can be, you need deep roots and the ability to express yourself even with the simplest tools such as a pencil in order to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good software does not necessarily create good graphics. </li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphics is not an independent art, but a service.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obtain a correct result, you need to put yourself on the side of the observer, on the side of the public.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good designer is the one who offers a good service through communication, not the one who wants to surprise at any cost, neither the one who wants to show how good he is.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="Level2.2.html">designer</a> is good if he can solve a problem, if he puts forward a useful solution.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that these rules could be a good start for a career in design.</li>
