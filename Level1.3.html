            <p>TI believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve, you should face it with rationality, logic and careful analysis if you want to get to the right idea. 
            <br>
            Graphic design is always a synthetic work: you need to reduce and remove until you reach the core of the message. 
            <br>When you work with typography and lettering, the essential goal is to obtain the best possible legibility.
        
            <br>To achieve this result, it is fundamental to know typography and its history.

            <p>As as this instrument can be, you need deep roots and the ability to express yourself even with the simplest tools—such as a pencil—in order to use it.
            <br>Graphics is not an independent art, but a service. To obtain a correct result, you need to put yourself on the side of the observer, on the side of the public.
            <br>The computer has become an essential tool but its undisputed utility and versatility cannot replace knowledge.
            <br>
            A good software does not necessarily create good graphics. 
            <br>
        
            
        
            <br><br><br>
            A good designer is the one who offers a good service through communication, not the one who wants to surprise at any cost, neither the one who wants to show.
            <br>
            A <a href="Level2.1.html">designer</a> is good if he can solve a problem, if he puts forward a useful solution.
            <br>
            I believe that these rules could be a good start for a career in design.
